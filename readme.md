##  General Information

  

**Objective:**

  

- Build a **CNN based model** which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths.

- A solution that can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.

  

**Dataset:**

  

The dataset consists of 2357 images of malignant and benign oncological diseases, which were formed from the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC). All images were sorted according to the classification taken with ISIC, and all subsets were divided into the same number of images, with the exception of melanomas and moles, whose images are slightly dominant.

  

The data set contains the following diseases:

  

- Actinic keratosis

- Basal cell carcinoma

- Dermatofibroma

- Melanoma

- Nevus

- Pigmented benign keratosis

- Seborrheic keratosis

- Squamous cell carcinoma

- Vascular lesion

  

##  Methodology

  

- Data Reading/Data Understanding

- Dataset Creation

- Dataset visualisation

- Model Building & training

- Data Augmentation

- Model Building & training on the augmented data

- Class distribution

- Handling class imbalances

- Model Building & training on the rectified class imbalance data

- Analysis on unseen test data

  

##  Repository contents

  

| File | Description |

|:-----|:------------|

| Python notebook | It contains the complete detailed code along with necessary output to solve the problem. |

| README.md | This file briefs about the project. |

| skin_cancer_ISIC_dataset/Train/ | Contains the train dataset. |

| skin_cancer_ISIC_dataset/Train/*/output | Contains the augmented train dataset. |

| skin_cancer_ISIC_dataset/Test/| Contains the test dataset. |

  

##  Conclusion
- Accuracy on training data has increased by using Augmentor library
- Model is still overfitting
- The problem of overfitting can be solved by add more layer,neurons or adding dropout layers.
- The Model can be further improved by tuning the hyperparameter
